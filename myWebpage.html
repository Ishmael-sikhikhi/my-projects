                    <p>
                        Church Square lies on the corner of Parliament and Spin streets, just south-west of St George's Cathedral and the Slave Lodge.

                        The little cobbled square, though perhaps not much to look at,  
                        has only recently been reclaimed from its former role as a parking lot. 
                        The square is surrounded by architecturally impressive buildings and provides a surprisingly quiet space in the heart of Cape Town

                    <h5>City hall</h5>
                    <p>Built in 1905, Cape Town’s City Hall is the first place from where Nelson Mandela spoke after his release from prison in 1990.

                        The honey-coloured City Hall in Cape Town has seen many changes in its years of standing vigil on the Grand Parade. It has seen South Africa develop into
                         the multi-cultural melting pot that it is today, and played a very important role in that change.
                        
                        Addressing over 10 000 jubilant people just hours after his release, Mandela famously had to borrow his wife’s reading glasses as he had left his in prison.
                         His speech, started with the words: "Comrades and fellow South Africans, I greet you all in the name of peace, democracy and freedom. 
                         I stand here before you not as a prophet, but as a humble servant of you the people."</p>

                    <p>
                        This cobbled square is Cape Town’s second-oldest public space after the Grand Parade. It hosts a lively and colourful crafts and souvenir market daily.
                         Apart from the Old Town House, the square is also surrounded by some choice examples of art deco architecture, including Market House,
                          an elaborately decorated building with balconies and stone-carved eagles and flowers on its facade.

                        Next to Market House, the dazzling-white Protea Asssurance Building was built in 1928 and renovated in 1990. 
                        Opposite is Shell House,
                         once the South African headquarters of Shell, now a hotel and restaurant.
